Let's talk about <em>gender.</em>

But what use is a conversation where only one side is speaking? So let's introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filomena">Filo,</a> who will serve as my conversationalist partner during this dialogue.

<strong>Filo:</strong> Greetings.

Greetings, Filo. Let's start this off on commonalities, before we scrutinize our differences. Do you have "gender", Filo?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Of course I have gender. I am gendered.

From where, and when, did you gain your gender, Filo? From what do you pull it from- from what spring does it well up inside you and inform your beliefs and perception of self? Is there one source of your gender, or multiple?

<strong>Filo:</strong> My gender came to me in three parts. First it came to me at birth, from my DNA. This informed my functions- which molded my gender, which in turn molded me and I, the royal we.

<strong>Filo:</strong> My gender then secondly came to me at adolescence, from my environment. This informed my role- which molded my place in society, which in turn molded me and I, the royal we.

<strong>Filo:</strong> My gender then thirdly came to me at maturity, from my internal self. This informed my patterns of thought- which molded my mind and how I think, which in turn molded me and I, the royal we.

So you gained your gender through nature and function, then through nurture and environment, and finally through the internal self- you?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Quite right.

## At Birth

First it came to you at birth?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Quite right.

From your DNA? From your chromosomes? From your bodily "functions?"

<strong>Filo:</strong> Yes.

How so?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Instincts. My cells instilled in my mind patterns of behavior, instincts, which would mold my gender- and thus my sense of self. Functions, too. My cells instilled in my body patterns of operation, functions, which would mold my gender- and thus my sense of self.

There are gendered instincts and functions?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly.

So, breaking it down to its most base assumption, there are XX and XY instincts and functions?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose.

So, one side gets a double dose of X instinct and function, and the other side is partially X and partially Y?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose.

So one side is a purity of one form- and the other side experiences in part the pure form, and in part another form, and is in its total a new form through the mix of two different forms?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose.

So one side is perhaps incapable of understanding the other- whereas the other is partly capable?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Perhaps. But the limitation would be the "functions" of the forms. One side is equipped with certain functions that curate the sense of gender. One might understand- but they can never "be". A wasp understands what it's like to be colored like a bee, but can never produce honey- and thus is not truly a "bee", can never be one, only "like" one. It may have a semblance of the form- but no capability for the function.

Interesting. Let's do away with being abstract for a second, and get down to brass tacks. Let's talk about women. Are breasts, and a womb, "functions" of being a woman? Is the instinct to nurse, the instinct to nurture, the instincts of being a woman?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly.

Is a woman without breasts, flat chested- or perhaps as a result of a mastectomy, "less" of a woman then?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly not.

Is a woman who is barren, incapable of producing a child, or perhaps without an interest in children, "less" of a woman then?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly not.

Is a woman who only has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome">single X chromosome</a> "less" of a woman then? 

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly not.

Is a woman who <em>has <a href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/swyer-syndrome/">a pair of <strong>X and Y chromosomes</strong></a> <strong>"less"</strong> of a woman?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose... not.

So a woman can lack the functions of breasts, can lack the function of a womb, can lack the instinct of child-rearing, can lack the chromosomal makeup of a typical woman, can <em>have the chromosomal makeup of a man,</em> and still not be any "less" of a woman?

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... I suppose that is true.

Can a man also lack the functions of his balls, can lack the function of a penis, can lack the instinct of alcoholism (joke), can lack the <a href="https://isna.org/faq/conditions/klinefelter/">chromosomal makeup of a typical man,</a> and still not be any "less" of a man?

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... I suppose that is also true.

Then by necessity, your gender is not \*enforced\* at your birth; by your birth?!

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... It is perhaps better to say: "suggested".

Suggested is... fine. Let's move on.

## At Adolescence

Second it came to you at adolescence?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Quite right.

From your environment? From your place in society? From the structured agreed-upon standards of the community?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Yes.

How so?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Archetypes. My forebearers instilled in my mind patterns of expression, archetypes, which would mold my gender- and thus my sense of self. How I dress, how I act, what I like and dislike. This would mold my gender- and thus my sense of self.

There are gendered likes and dislikes?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly.

So, breaking it down to its most base assumption, there are male and female likes and dislikes?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose.

So what does a "woman" like?

<strong>Filo:</strong> My society says dresses.

What if a woman does not like dresses? Is she "less" of a woman?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose I have suggested as much.

What about the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_clothing">traditional male Japanese garb?</a> Are these men more "womanly"? Are they "less" of a man because they prefer to wear dresses?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose... Not. It is on a per-society basis.

So it is arbitrary?

<strong>Filo:</strong> We see commonalities across cultures, there must be a deeper rule to it.

And the cultures that are exceptions, they are the ones that prove the rule?

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... Perhaps.

And men with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hair">long hair?</a> And men who wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt">skirts?</a> And men who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera">sing?</a> 

What about men who stay at home and clean while the woman works? What about women who go off to war? What about liking the fucking color pink? Dancing? Art? Simultaneously it is suggested by some that men can do these activities "better" than a woman can, but by innately doing them they become less of a man- and more like a woman?! Absurdity.

Are these men are all "less" of a man? The women, "less" of a woman??

<strong>Filo:</strong> ...

So it is \*pure\* arbitrarity? By necessity, your gender is not \*enforced\* at your adolescence; by your environment?!

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... It is perhaps better to say that society "suggests" it.

Suggested is... tiresome. But fine, let's move on.

<hr>

Finally, it came to you at maturity?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Quite right.

From your internal sense of self? From your mind? From your... spirit?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Yes.

How so?

<strong>Filo:</strong> The me. The pure "me" inside. My soul, the truest and purest me, the me that which informs the full me, the actions of me- the ideas and thoughts of me- the me that I am and the me that is me.

A bit of a world salad.

<strong>Filo:</strong> Just trying to be comprehensive.

Do you believe in souls?

<strong>Filo:</strong> We're all a little spiritual, aren't we?

So, does god make a male soul and female soul?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Perhaps.

Could he place them in incorrect bodies?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Nothing is beyond god.

Could he make a soul that is both male and female?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Perhaps.

Could he make a soul that is \*neither\*?

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... Perhaps.

This is arbitrarity. Fine, let's focus on "you". Is your mind a "gender"?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Assuredly.

So there is a gendered spark of neurons, there are male and female patterns, distinct, upon the brain?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I suppose.

Can one change their pattern, can one change their way of thought?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Of course not- that's decided at birth by their-

By their chromosomes? By their DNA?

<strong>Filo:</strong> Hrmmm...

Ooo, ooo- perhaps it's by their <em>soul?</em>

<strong>Filo:</strong> I- well...

Golly, perhaps this mystical brain pattern is decided by their society?! By their culture?!

<strong>Filo:</strong> ...

Can you look at these patterns and figure out if they're male or female?!

<strong>Filo:</strong> ...

Can I just <em>\*think\*</em> myself into a different pattern?!

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... Perhaps.

Then by necessity, your gender is not \*enforced\* at your maturity; by your maturity?! By the "patterns" in your brain, by the "soul" in your body? By the influence of society- by the influence of your makeup?

<strong>Filo:</strong> I would suggest it is a culmination of these things.

Dogshit. The concept is arbitrary- it's made up. The rules don't exist.

<strong>Filo:</strong> Perhaps. But I still feel this way.

And I can feel like a sea-otter, but given I've never been a sea-otter- this would merely by my stereotyped anthropomorphized projection of what a sea-otter would feel like- aka, <em>dogshit.</em>

<strong>Filo:</strong> Could you not say the same of gender?

Per-fuckin'-haps. But if it's not form, if it's not function, if it's not society, if it's not the soul- what in the hell is it?

<strong>Filo:</strong> ... Arbitrary. But, to many, meaningful arbitrarity.

Meaningless arbitrary dogshit in my opinion.
