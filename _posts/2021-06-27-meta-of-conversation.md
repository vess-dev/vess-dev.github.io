Let's talk about <em>conversation starters.</em>

If you've known me for any length of time, you may already be familiar with my spiel on this topic. But hey- it helps to have a formalized method behind the madness on paper.

Have you ever had someone come up to you and say the words "Guess what?", while perhaps clutching something behind their back with a smug expression? This person will then classify themselves into one of three types of people with their actions in the next minute. If they tell you what it is after you guess incorrectly one time- they are someone that may yet be redeemed. If they tell you what it is after a few guesses, giving you prompts and suggestions to bring you closer to the truth with each attempt you make- they are bordering on psychopathy. And if they adamantly and stalwartly remain silent as you flounder to figure out what it is- and simply say "Guess again!" each time you incorrectly grasp at the complete lack of straws they've given you, they're probably <em>a <strong>demon</strong> incarnate.</em> They were sent to torture the souls of the living by their mere presence.

This is something I usually tell people if it ever comes up, I completely, utterly, and wholeheartedly <strong>HATE</strong> <em>empty words for empty conversations.</em> Never in a million years would I guess what you actually want to tell me. All it generally serves as, which is the broader topic of this article, is a conversation starter. Person A wants to tell Person B something. Person A however doesn't know the best way to broach the topic, so instead of leaping into it they engage in some form of learned ritualistic tradition of starting a conversation. "What's up? How are you? Guess what?" etc. If I answer "How are you?" with "Suicidal", now <em>I've</em> ruined the mood- as if the question wasn't asked with honest intent to know how I'm doing in the current moment. And if they ask "What's up?" I'm pretty sure they can \*see\* what I'm actively doing at the moment.

Some other irritating examples include "You're cute.", "Love you.", and other generalized statements that beget some unspoken requirement to respond in kind. Have you ever received a compliment and felt indebted to immediately give a compliment back? Why is it that people can hold such power over each other, making <em>you</em> feel bad if you don't compliment them back?

I think about this <em>"meta"</em> of conversation often. It's almost upsetting when you key into it how much we say empty words to prompt conversation or keep one going without much thought or effort. So I propose an alternative. I, as Person B, care about you, Person A, your interests, your hobbies, and what you have to say. I care about and enjoy your company- we wouldn't be friends otherwise. So here's my alternative solution... Skip the pedantry. Skip the empty meaningless turns of phrase. Let's say what we mean- and <em>mean</em> what we say. Let's talk about ideas, events, and greater and better things. Let's skip the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/">TCP Handshakes</a>, the vain attempts to fill the silence. (When we could've just comfortable enjoyed each other's company.)

And just tell me what you wanted to tell me. Because I care about it- no guessing required.
