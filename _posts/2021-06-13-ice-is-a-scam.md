Let's talk about <em>ice.</em>

When you go to a fast food joint and grab a drink to go, often your cup is full of ice. Like not just full-full, but drown the drink itself in ice kind of full. This in my opinion is a scam. You are getting:

1. Less to drink as the ice takes up a large amount of volume.
2. More ice that will water down and dilute what you have to drink.
3. A cup of leftover ice that \*could\* have been space for more liquid.

Of course most people would respond rather quickly: <em>"But I like my drink cold! The ice keeps it cold!"</em> And assuredly, I do not disagree with this. While the notion of a cold drink with ice is a rather <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-dont-other-countries-use-ice-cubes-50361097">western notion,</a> I too am fond of a chilled beverage on these recently hot summer days. But consider the following:

1. The drink comes out of the machine already frigidly cold.
2. You often will finish drinking it by the time it would have gotten warm.
3. You still could have done with less ice by the simple fact of how much is usually left over.

Then people generally respond in a different way. <em>"Soda is cents on the dollar. Why would they need to dilute it?"</em> And this I must contend with. While the amount of soda is perhaps <em>nearly</em> negligible, it is not <strong>entirely</strong> so. Even a few cents adds up over the hundreds of drinks any fast food place will serve over the course of a day.

Additionally, if you find that you always seem to finish your drink with ice leftover, would you not also finish it in time before it warmed up?

I rest my case. Perhaps next time you get a drink- consider getting less ice. Don't let the system win.
