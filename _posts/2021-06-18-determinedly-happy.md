Let's talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism"><em>determinism.</em></a>

For this article I'll cover 2 broad and generalized patterns of thought I've had related to the topic of determinism.

Disclaimer: I do not have formal experience or training in this area of philosophy- these are simply, as per this blog's name, a corner for the thoughts I've had about certain subjects. It's enjoyable to put these thoughts to paper in an unchallenged domain of my own at times.

The sections covered are as follows:

1. "Proving" Determinism (For those that have never thought of / known of it.)
2. Living with Determinism (How to deal with the consequences of determinism.)

## "Proving" Determinism

First let me lay out a cursory view of what determinism is, and then go through a few closer views of ways we can go about "proving" it. If you're already familiar with determinism some of these points may not be new to you.

A simple explanation of determinism is that it's a school of thought that "free will" is not something that exists. Our perception of our own free will is merely an abstraction, an illusion if you will, that allows us to function on a day to day basis. And our decision making- what we would commonly call our free will, is otherwise pre<em>determined</em> by various factors such as:

1. The physical reality of what our brains are and how they operate.
2. The lack of wiggle room between both nature and nurture.

Disclaimer: If you're religious you can simply respond with "I have a soul, my free will stems from that- not a physical reality." and you've won. I can't <em>\*prove\*</em> you wrong, and you are incapable of proving yourself right. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Calvinism">Here's an article you may find more fun in that case.</a>

### 1. The Physical Reality

We exist in a reality of rules. Science for the past few hundred years has been a series of continuous trials of testing the boundaries of these rules, how they work, and how we can exploit them. Let's walk through a straightforward example of how these rules relate to determinism, (If you're a smart cookie you know where I'm going with this.) and then tackle the obvious complex example that follows.

Let's say you have a ball at the top of a hill.

In this hypothetical we thankfully have a team of scientists nearby equipped with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate">IBM5100 personal supercomputer.</a> They have a book of mathematical formulas (What scientist doesn't...) for determining how slopes affect speed. They crunch numbers, stain whiteboards, and imbibe coffee for an hour or two and come back with an answer: how far the ball should go when rolled down the hill.

But wait- what about the current wind speed?

Sure. They take another hour, adjust for the speed of the wind, and come back with a closer answer.

But "A-ha!" you cry, what about friction?

Of course of course. They take another hour, adjust for friction, and come back with yet an even closer answer.

OBJECTION: What about slight fluctuations in quantum particles that bubble up the layers of reality into our larger observable physical universe, causing slightly divergent behavior than would have been expected? Your answer will never be spot on. To measure these particles would require you to test their state- and by testing their state you inherently alter it.

Well... On that you'd be correct. At least <em>almost</em> correct. But we'll come back to that in the complex example. For now let's say that the IBM5100 personal supercomputer gets a teensy upgrade: <em>It now belongs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question">Asimov</a> and was culpable for the creation of our universe.</em> While this was widely regarded as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">bad move,</a> it lets our supercomputer know the current state of all things without having to test them, as it was the progenitor of them- and it's a simply trivial exercise to crunch the numbers and figure out what each successive state of the universe will be.

Now we have everything to solve the question we started with. We can tell how far the ball will go when it is rolled down the hill. We know the force applied to it, we know the weight of it, we know the degree of the slope of the hill, and we know exactly how buzzy each little buzzing atomic particle is down to the smallest level.

Now- let's talk about the more complex example. The human brain. At a fundamental level you may or may not be familiar with how a neuron works, but the gist is rather straightforward. Small little cells in your head exchange chemicals and electrical signals with each other rapidly every second billions of times. Your specific clump of brain matter is made up of around a few dozen billion of these neurons. However you probably get where I'm going with this... A single neuron is a simple entity. It has parts that interact with the parts of the neurons surrounding it. These parts and their interactions follow concrete rules. They have always followed these concrete rules- and always \*will\* follow them for as long as you live.

This means that if we had, perhaps, let's say a team of scientists nearby... And they had a handy dandy book of formulas for these neurons... And a special IBM5100 personal supercomputer... You, your personality, your entire being, is nothing more than many-many-many balls rolling down hills. And the state of your brain- or rather the state of your brain 1 second from now is something that can be provably determined. And if it can be provably determined- then what \*is\* free will? You don't particularly have a "choice". Assuredly to you it seems like you do, just as sure as the ball is unaware of how far it will roll when pushed down the hill. You are, simply, the ball on top of the hill. And you are, simply, unsure of just how far you will roll when pushed. But there will be a hard point at which you stop whether you know it or not.

This is the concrete and inescapable physical reality of which our brains reside. Tough luck bud, get to rolling.

<strong>Caveat:</strong> Some would bring up examples of "random entropy". That at the quantum level (State observation aside, as this is a tad different.) particles and quarks and threads sometimes act <em>"odd".</em> (Let's ignore that just because we don't know what rule they're following doesn't mean there \*is\* no rule in the first place.) However, sadly, this has little to no relevance doesn't it? Let's say the ball rolls < or > 1 inch from time to time. Is this free will? Is one of your synapses firing randomly at one point in time "free will"? Does this mean that sometimes you have "more" or "less" free will? No, of course not. Even the concept of measuring free will becomes quickly and patently absurd. If you'd like: think about it for a bit. Think about what an unexpected random result means in the greater context of free will in your own personal choices. Think about what it's like to have more or less free will and how you'd measure it.

When you find the resounding answer of "literally nothing", we shall continue. But sure. To those that bring up this caveat... Perhaps we can't <em>perfectly</em> determine everything all of the time. That may actually be a true unwritten rule of the universe. But this still does not bring us any closer to our concept of "free will", only that the ball sometimes surprises those watching it roll down the hill.

### 2. Nature and Nurture

Now let's talk about the lack of wiggle room between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture">nature and nurture.</a> Coming off of the first point this serves as a proverbial <strong>"nail in the coffin"</strong> for the idea of free will in the context of determinism.

Assuming we've accepted the concrete truth of our physical reality...

If we accept nature as a successive truth: Then many of your choices will stem from biases literally etched into your DNA, instincts, and soupy slimy slippery grey matter. This doesn't particularly sound like free will.

If we accept nurture as a successive truth: Then many of your choices will stem from biases beaten into your flesh by your friends, parents, and the incredibly toxic environment you grew up in. This doesn't particularly sound like free will either.

If we accept that the truth is some middle ground between the two... That the person you are is in part <strong><em>\*bred\*</em></strong> into you and cannot be changed- and that the experiences are in part <strong><em>\*beaten\*</em></strong> into you and cannot be changed- then the resulting person, much like the previous thought experiment, is the result of A + B.

And this doesn't particularly sound like free will. In part, this is actually incredibly frustrating for me as a person. Let me explain.

I'm afraid of dogs. When I was a wee lass a family dog attacked me and bit me. Now, even as an adult, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(streamer)">pure bastion of logic and reason and fact,</a> I can't help but startle and wince whenever a dog jumps or barks at me. It inspires a small amount of terror in me when it happens that takes quite a few seconds to recover from. Do I know better than to startle? Yes. Do I startle anyways? Also yes.

<strong>YOU-</strong> as a person, are the: Exact. <em>Same.</em> <strong><em>Way.</em></strong> You are a culmination of many dogs biting you. When you were disciplined a bit too much. When a person of a different walk of life was rude to you. When you got a bad first impression and it forever stained your view of someone or something. You are a hundred thousand of these little biases... Because that's what humans are. Millions of years of evolution produced a beautiful pattern recognition machine: The brain. And every single moment of every single day it is looking for patterns to latch onto, because if it can recognize a pattern then it can exploit, profit, and or avoid it faster.

And that... Is incredibly frustrating to me. How do I bring myself to overcome startling at dogs? To overcome the nature and nurture? A year of therapy for something that became so deeply ingrained in a split second moment? How do I deal with the biases that become rooted in me while I'm getting that therapy in the following months? It's impossible. And it sucks. It's a fact of life that many of us are unaware of, some of us willfully ignorant of, and it guides our every thought and action. This is generally what's referred to as unconscious biases when discussing systemic issues. And as you may see they're terribly difficult to combat.

For what it's worth I try and critically view why I think about certain things the way I do- I try to find and rip out these biases as actively as I can. But it's... Really quite difficult. And certainly throws a wrench in the idea of "free will". It also makes it impossible to convince your friends of different ideas, views, or beliefs- as you may be struggling with doing so right now as you read this.

"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled."

## Living with Determinism

Now, there are a few problems that people come to if they've accepted determinism. These are epistemicly natural possible conclusions one could make if you continue to trace the logic towards an end.

	"If everything is determined, am I *culpable* for my actions?"

What if since the big bang of the universe, the absolute kegger of a party that pushed the first ball down the first hill and now you have to work a 9-5 job and pay bills- you were simply fated to kill your landlord? How can you be responsible for that? Well, in part, you can't be, can you? No more than the DNA and parents that influenced you into being the kind of person that would make that choice can be. This is where the illusion of free will that we all operate with in our day to day lives comes into play. This is also more specifically known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism">compatibilism.</a> It's the idea that accepting determinism doesn't necessarily preclude our simultaneous acceptance that a person is responsible for the "choices" they make. While to a hard-determinist this might seem like a bizzaro world where we punish people for simply fulfilling the inevitable outcomes of the requirements imposed on them by existence, it is also simply the only possible sane set of shared understanding for us to operate under.

We can't live in a world where people kill eachother with little to no justification and then get off scott free for just following the rules. Or can we? <em>Haha... <strong>:^)</strong></em>

	"If everything is determined, what's the point of living?"

Honestly? I have no idea. I suppose you have to \*choose\* your own reason. If you're an atheist and you're reading this, you probably already have chosen your own reason. However biting the bullet of determinism makes it a tad bit harder, doesn't it? (It's funny the religious debate over this exact thing- God being their own form of the issue of determinism.) It's one thing to at first accept there is no god and there is no ultimate plan for yourself- and then another thing to accept there infact is a plan- one that you literally can never deviate from. It is <strong>THE</strong> plan you were fated to follow since the very BEGINNING. In many ways that's kind of shitty. But in many ways it's also freeing.

Any bad thing that happens to you? It was always going to. You are not being targeted by the universe- it just was fated to happen.

You make a mistake? No worries. Not really your fault. Still something you should learn from, of course, but don't sweat it that hard. You wouldn't have \*not\* made it in the first place.

And the good things that happen to you? You, in a way, deserve them. They were fated FOR <strong>YOU</strong> and no one else. Enjoy them.

Regardless... Despite determinism, you determine how to feel and react to it. Or do you? <em>Haha... <strong>:^)</strong></em>

And I'm determined to be happy.

I'm determinedly happy.
