This article requires a cursory understanding of determinism, which you can <a href="https://vess-dev.github.io/2021/06/18/determinedly-happy/">read about here.</a>

Let's talk about <em>tarot.</em>

I've always personally had a rather poor opinion of astrology, horoscopes, crystals, fortunes, and the various other diet-occultism related practices that seem like what American Japanese food is to actual Japanese food: a bland caricature devoid of heart and soul- meant only to cursorily entertain the masses and those unwilling to dedicate themselves to stricter practices and principles. 

I however have <em>\*full\*</em> respect for those that apply their efforts full-tilt into mystic rituals and tradition. While the "power" these grant from a scientific perspective are... Let's put it nicely, dubious; they are of a considerable league above their snake-oil counterparts. Investing into the candles, required tokens, purified shrines, and well-timed moon cycles with clear and directed ritualistic tradition passed down through the many ages merits some amount of admiration. (Note: For the additional reason of catharsis I mention later as well.) If you'll discount the appeal to tradition and sunk-cost fallacy, I think most would agree a Christian that's read the bible is better than one who claims to be Christian yet has never read it. I find these two comparable in terms of how I think of them, even if say, both are preaching hateful rhetoric. One of them at least has their money where their mouth is.

Now tarot on the other horseshoe remains an oddly appealing practice. This may at first seem odd, even hypocritical- as if I'm operating on a biased level of cognitive dissonance, but I assuredly have copiously designed my delicate circus of mental justification. Recently tarot appears to be heading the same way as some of its brothers and sisters: a corporatized and commoditized shell of its former self. The moment you see small cardboard boxed versions on the Barnes and Noble checkout stands you know that your once favored hobby is well and truly on its way to being dead.

Tarot has an interesting and long history despite its recent resurgence, one of course filled with many conflicting ideals and interpretations as is typical with much of the occult. Repeated appeal to tradition aside, this isn't necessarily what attracts me to it. What I'm appealed by is two things:

1. The cathartic meditative reflection.
2. The fact it was <em>meant for me.</em>

To specifically discuss the first point, and to tangentially again mention my respect of those committed to occult practices, I feel like magic, in part, is a cathartic process. Tarot reading doubly so. The most general explanation of tarot is that for a 78 card deck of 4 suits of 14 cards in the "minor arcana", and 22 unique cards of the "major arcana", you ask a question and pull a certain amount of cards. These cards, depending if they are pulled in a reversed position or not, connect to various established "meanings" in the community. You then consider the position, order, art, and meaning of the cards, and thread a narrative answer to the question you asked. While this is obviously superstition, is it not on some level cathartic? It's a process of pseudo-guided contemplation of the troubles you face. One could point out that you could have done this regardless without the cards- but as with many things, humanity as a species generally find it easier to process these kinds of emotions through prompt or symbolic methods to channel them.

To then discuss the second point, I feel as if the practice builds off of determinism. Let's say with 78 cards, you pull 3 of them. You then consider their orientation and <em>\*order\*.</em> This is mathematically...  An obscenely large number. More than there are atoms in the universe, and then some. So if we then factor in determinism- if we factor in the beautifully chaotic and complex trajectory of every single atom since the big bang and the incomprehensible amount of events that occurred in their wake before coming to their final <em><strong>\*predetermined\*</strong></em> resting place in the cards that you drew... To me, it feels as if in this instant, in this moment, in this ephemeral blip in the vague undying aeons of celestial soup- that these cards, in relation to the question I asked, were <em>meant <strong>for ME.</strong></em>

Of course they're also as meant for me as the bowl of cereal I ate this morning was.

So c'est la vie. Can't win them all. I just find tarot... Appealing, for the aforementioned reasons. And maybe you do now too, even slightly.
